# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for our interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

There are three main python files in this project; two in PyGame and one in OpenCV. The PyGame file titled "whack_a_mole_no_cv.py" is the code for our mvp that runs the Whack-a-Mole game with a mouse controller. The PyGame file titled "whack_a_mole.py" is the code for the PyGame portion of the final Gual-a_Mole game that is paired with the OpenCV file "WhackAMoleOpenCV.py". Also in the folder are the image files necessary to display the visuals correctly and the sound files necessary to play the sound effects correctly.

Open the whack_a_mole.py and WhackAMoleOpenCV.py files in Sublime Text and run from the whack_a_mole.py file to play Guac-a-Mole! Make sure you have something blue in your hand for the OpenCV to detect and no other blue in the space around you!

Open the whack_a_mole_no_cv.py file and run in Sublime Text to play the mouse controlled version of Whack-a-Mole!
